# About

Basic Android app for keeping track of photography settings while shooting analog film. As used by
analog photographers who can't rely on exif information when using analog roll film while shooting.

# Goals

Keep it dead simple and easy to use. The photographer shouldn't have to look into settings or any
complex editing options while shooting. Keep distraction to an absolute minimum.

* create a new film roll adding film type, nr of frames and ISO exposed at (!film ISO)
